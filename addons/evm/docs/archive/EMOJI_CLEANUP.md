# Emoji Character Cleanup

## Summary
Removed all emoji characters (✅, ❌, etc.) from test files to resolve compilation errors.

## Problem
The Rust compiler was encountering issues with Unicode emoji characters in string literals, causing:
- Unterminated string literal errors
- Unknown prefix errors  
- General compilation failures

## Solution
Systematically removed all emoji characters from test output messages while preserving the semantic meaning of the messages.

## Files Modified
All test files in `addons/evm/src/tests/` that contained emoji characters:
- debug_eth_transfer_tests.rs
- integration/create2_deployment_tests.rs
- integration/deployment_tests.rs
- integration/foundry_deploy_tests.rs
- integration/insufficient_funds_tests.rs
- integration/migrated_abi_tests.rs
- integration/migrated_deployment_tests.rs
- integration/migrated_transaction_tests.rs
- integration/transaction_tests.rs
- integration/txtx_eth_transfer_tests.rs
- integration/view_function_tests.rs
- project_test_harness.rs
- test_failed_preservation.rs
- validate_setup_tests.rs

## Impact
- All tests now compile successfully
- No functional changes to test logic
- Cleaner, more portable test output
