# EVM Addon Test Migration Documentation Index

## üìö Overview

This index provides a central reference point for all test migration and fixture system documentation for the EVM addon. The migration effort aims to transform ~83 tests from direct Alloy usage to txtx framework integration using a YAML-based fixture system.

## STATUS 

- [ ] Initial test harness framework. The current tests are a little better than nonsense,
to test the harness workflow
  - [ ] Anvil interaction created; but is naive;
  - [ ] Could explore using a single instance of Anvil with CREATE2, or
  different deployers for testing
  - [x] Foundry contract framework works
  - [ ] Hardhat contract framework tbd
- [ ] Tests are not yet valid. There needs to be a better criteria/spec for them

Tests need to be validated.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### To migrate your first test:

1. **Check current status:**
   ```bash
   cat TEST_HARNESS_TRACKER.md | grep "Overall Progress" -A 5
   ```

2. **Find a test to migrate:**
   ```bash
   grep "üî¥ Not Started" TEST_HARNESS_TRACKER.md
   ```

3. **Follow the migration guide:**
   - Open [TEST_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](./TEST_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md#step-by-step-migration-process)
   - Find similar example pattern
   - Create YAML fixture
   - Test and validate

4. **Track your progress:**
   ```bash
   cargo test --package txtx-addon-network-evm -- --nocapture fixture_cli migrate old_test_name new_fixture.yml
   ```
