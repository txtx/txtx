## Session Log

### Session 1 (Initial Analysis)
- Identified 83 tests, only ~10% using txtx
- Found critical blocker: `execute_runbook()` doesn't execute actions
- Created initial migration plan

### Session 2 (Core Execution Fix)
- ✅ Fixed `execute_runbook()` with txtx-core integration
- ✅ Added Anvil lifecycle management
- ✅ Created proof-of-concept ETH transfer test
- 🚧 Identified signer initialization issue

### Session 3 (Fixture System Implementation)
- ✅ Designed and implemented runbook-based fixture system
- ✅ Created 5 core modules (loader, executor, validator, tracker)
- ✅ Built SQLite tracking and HTML dashboard
- ✅ Added CLI tool for fixture management
- ✅ Created 2 example fixtures
- ✅ All fixture tests passing (5/5)

### Session 4 (Simplification & ETH Transfer Success)
- ✅ Removed over-engineered fixture system (2,831 lines removed)
- ✅ Fixed signer initialization (integer vs string issue)
- ✅ Fixed runbook field mappings (to → recipient_address)
- ✅ Got ETH transfer test working end-to-end
- ✅ Added temp directory preservation for debugging failures
- ✅ Verified on-chain state changes with Anvil
- ✅ Documented fixture projects for complex tests

### Session 5 (Test Migration & Error-Stack Insights)
- ✅ Successfully migrated 3 more tests
  - test_create2_address_calculation - pure computation
  - test_deploy_simple_storage_from_foundry - real foundry project
  - test_insufficient_funds tests - error cases
- ✅ Enhanced ProjectTestHarness to copy entire foundry projects
  - Copies src/, out/, foundry.toml from fixtures
  - Preserves compiled artifacts for testing
- 🔍 Key Learning: Error-stack migration critical for debugging
  - Current errors lack context (e.g., "invalid character '.' at position 1")
  - Without error-stack, real errors are masked (insufficient funds → connection error)
  - call_contract needs error-stack to diagnose ABI issues
- ✅ Workaround: Used direct Alloy calls to verify deployment

## Known Issues & Blockers

### ✅ RESOLVED
- ~~Signer State Issue~~ - Fixed: was passing string instead of integer for amount
- ~~Action execution~~ - Fixed: using unsupervised mode correctly
- ~~Field mapping issues~~ - Fixed: using correct field names

### Medium Priority
- CI integration pending
- Need to migrate remaining 81 tests

## Next Actions (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Next Session)
1. [ ] Migrate call_contract action to error-stack for better debugging
2. [ ] Fix call_contract ABI handling issues
3. [ ] Complete remaining deployment tests with CREATE2
4. [ ] Continue migrating action tests (35 remaining)

### Key Insights from Migration
- **Error-stack is essential**: Without it, debugging is nearly impossible
- **Temp directory preservation**: Invaluable for debugging failures
- **Foundry project integration**: Works well with copied artifacts
- **Direct verification**: Sometimes bypassing txtx actions helps identify issues

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. [ ] Set up CI integration for fixture tests
2. [ ] Create automated migration script
3. [ ] Add performance benchmarking
4. [ ] Document troubleshooting guide

### Long Term (Month)
1. [ ] Complete all 83 test migrations
2. [ ] Remove legacy test infrastructure
3. [ ] Create migration guide for other addons
4. [ ] Set up coverage reporting
