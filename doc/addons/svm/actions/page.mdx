## deploy_subgraph {{ tag: 'action' }}

`svm::deploy_subgraph` creates a live Graph QL database for your program.

This command takes a program ID to index, a block height to start indexing from, and a set of events to index.
This data is encoded as a request and sent to your surfnet (when deploying to localhost) or to the Surfpool cloud services (when deploying to devnet or mainnet).
When the request is received, the associated chain is indexed and the data is stored in a Graph QL database.

## setup_surfnet {{ tag: 'action' }}

`svm::setup_surfnet` can be used to configure a surfnet.

The following operations are supported:
 - `set_account` - used to set the lamports, owner, data, and executable fields of an account.
 - `set_token_account` - used to set the amount, delegate, delegated amount, and close authority for a token account.
 - `clone_program_account` - used to clone a program account from a source program id to a destination program id.
 - `set_program_authority` - used to set the authority of a program.
 - `deploy_program` - used to deploy a program (via a direct write to the account data rather than valid transactions) to the surfnet.
