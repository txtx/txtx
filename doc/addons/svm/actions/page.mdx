## deploy_subgraph {{ tag: 'action' }}

`svm::deploy_subgraph` creates a live Graph QL database for your program.

This command takes a program ID to index, a block height to start indexing from, and a set of events to index.
This data is encoded as a request and sent to your surfnet (when deploying to localhost) or to the Surfpool cloud services (when deploying to devnet or mainnet).
When the request is received, the associated chain is indexed and the data is stored in a Graph QL database.

If not specified, the default is 1000 milliseconds (1 second).

  - **behavior**: The behavior if the post-condition assertion does not pass. Possible values are:
    - **halt** (default): Throws an error and halts execution of the runbook
    - **log**: Logs a warning and continues execution of the runbook
    - **skip**: Skips execution of this command and all downstream commands
    - **continue**: Continues execution without any action

  - **assertion**: The assertion to check to determine if the command should be re-executed or if the post-condition behavior should be executed. This value should evaluate to a boolean, or the `std::assert_eq` and other assertions from the standard library can be used.
