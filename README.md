## What is Txtx?

Txtx enhances the blockchain development experience by introducing the concept of Smart Contract Runbooks. These runbooks serve as detailed guides to ensure that interactions with the blockchain, such as contract deployments and calls, are consistent and reliable. Written in declarative languages like JSON or YAML, Smart Contract Runbooks describe the necessary transactions for deploying or interacting with smart contracts in a chain-agnostic manner. This approach not only promotes standardization and composability but also enhances explainability, making the developer's job more straightforward and efficient.

By utilizing Txtx, developers can leverage these runbooks to create reproducible workflows, which are essential for maintaining robustness in blockchain operations. The Txtx toolchain also includes a dashboard that aids in the execution and monitoring of these runbooks, providing a comprehensive solution for web3 developers. This innovation addresses the current gaps in web3 developer tooling, such as the lack of standardization and composability, and paves the way for more efficient and collaborative blockchain development.

## Quick Start

The txtx CLI tool can be installed via our install script or through a manual build.

### Install on macOs (Homebrew)

To install txtx on a macOS system using Homebrew, open a terminal and run:

```bash
brew tap txtx/txtx
brew install txtx
```

Other installation options are available and described in our [doc website](https://docs.txtx.sh/install).
